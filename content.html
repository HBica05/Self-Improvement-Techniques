                <li><p>Mindfulness meditation involves focusing on the present moment without judgment, observing thoughts, emotions, and bodily sensations. Regular practice enhances self-awareness, emotional regulation, and reduces stress. It improves concentration, fosters resilience, and promotes overall well-being.

                <li><p>In a review of meditation studies, researchers proposed that mindfulness meditation fosters metacognitive awareness, reduces rumination by diverting attention from repetitive thought patterns, and improves attentional abilities by enhancing working memory. These cognitive improvements, consequently, aid in the development of effective emotion-regulation techniques.</p>
