        <p>Mindfulness meditation fosters an attitude of compassion and nonjudgment toward both yourself and others, leading to greater overall well-being and resilience.</p>
        <p>In a review of meditation studies, researchers proposed that mindfulness meditation fosters metacognitive awareness, reduces rumination by diverting attention from repetitive thought patterns, and improves attentional abilities by enhancing working memory. These cognitive improvements, consequently, aid in the development of effective emotion-regulation techniques.</p>
