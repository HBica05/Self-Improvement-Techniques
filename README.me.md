# Deployment
The site was created using Gitpod editor and pushed to Github to the remote repository 'Self-Improvement-Techniques'.
Git commands were used throughout the development to push the code to the remote repository. The following git commands were used:

 - git 
add . to add the files to the staging area before being committed.

 - git commit -m "commit message" to commit changes to the local repository queue that are ready for the final step.
 
- git push to push all committed code to the remote repository on Github.
  
## Deployment to Github pages
-The site was deployed to Github pages as follows:
- From dashboard, select the project you'd like to create a deployment for.
- Select the Deployments tab. 
- Once on the Deployments page, select the Create Deployment button.
- Select Create Deployment. Vercel will build and deploy your commit or branch.

## üîçTesting
