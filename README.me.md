## üêû Bugs encountered
- During the development of this website, problems such as media queries not working for all screensizes were encountered. These were fixed with the help of accessing various resources and a lot of research.

- Adding images was also a problem, at the end I discovered that the file path to the image was not properly written in HTML code.
  
- The same with the Favicon. The Favicon was not appearing due to wrong file path stated in the HTML files.  
  
## Unfixed bugs
- No unfixed bugs reported at this time.
